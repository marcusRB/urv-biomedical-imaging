## P0_1. Introduction to Jupiter Notebook + Pandas
Requisits de compleció

Practicum P0_1 is an introduction session. Practicum P0_1 consists in reviewing the concepts of

1)    How to include markdowns in your python jupyter --> in this case please follow the "Mastering Markdown" tutorial

2)    How to load and manage databases using Pandas library--> in this case please follow the "P0 - Panda Tutorial" tutorial

In case you are familiar with Pandas, please complete Practicum Block-0 task by filling the jupyter notebook.

The Practicum 0_1 should not be delivered and it is meant as a self-evaluating test.

In case you have any doubt during the Practicum 0, do not hesitate to review your skills by completing the Pandas tutorials (there is always some new feature to learn...)

## Practicum P0_2 is an introduction session. Practicum P0_2 consists in reviewing the concepts of

1)    How to perform basic image manipulation
2)    How to use COLAB and manage GPU resources



## P1: Computed Tomography Image Visualisation & Reconstruction
Requisits de compleció

In this practicum, you will work with several topics covered in the theory sessions. In particular you will (1) simulate a simple and more complex phantoms, (2) apply Radom forward transformation to simulate the computed tomography (CT) projections over a single slice (i.e. sinograms) and (3) reconstruct the original phantom intensity values using different image reconstruction algorithms. In addition, the Shepp–Logan phantom will be used to analyse noise during reconstruction.

A ZIP file will be submitted containing your jupyter notebook (*.ipynb) file. The name of the file will be P1-MI-NAME1_SURNAME1_NAME2_SURNAME2_NAME3_SURNAME3.ipynb
